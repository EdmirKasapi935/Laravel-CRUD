This is a CRUD application is amde using Laravel 11. It was created as an extension ot the CRUD application i made in PHP with a similar topic(Car rental admin dashboard). It is recommended to open the application folder using VSCode(Visual Studio Code).<br/>
In order to run the application, you need:<br/>
-XAMPP for PHP and MySQL.<br/>
-Composer, to install Laravel.<br/>
-Node.js for Vite development server.<br/>
-Laravel Livewire, since this project was made using livewire.<br/>

How to install laravel 11:https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation <br/>
Make sure to import the database to XAMPP's MySQL.<br/>

After the aforementioned platforms have been successfully installed and the database has been imported, simply open the folder using VSCode and enter these commands in separate terminals:<br/>
-php artisan serve, to start the php server.<br/>

P.S: A lot of the data in the database is dummy data meant to be a filler, the pictures were also randomly taken and are unrelated.
